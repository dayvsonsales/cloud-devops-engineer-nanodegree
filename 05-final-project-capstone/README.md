# Udacity DevOps Nanodegree Capstone Project

This repository contains the codes for the final project of the Udacity DevOps course.

The ``.aws`` and ``.nginx`` folders contain the codes to deploy the clusters and code to be copied to the docker image which is built by Jenkins.

The project used Amazon CloudFormation, Jenkins, and Kubernetes (managed by Amazon EKS) and rolling update techniques to update application pods.
