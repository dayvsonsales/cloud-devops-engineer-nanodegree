# Udacity Cloud DevOps Nanodegree Program 2020

This repository contains all of the project solutions that I developed during nanodegree course. Some of them were made to work as a separate repository (in order to use CI/CD), but I decided to join all of them in a monorepo.

## About

The Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree program is geared towards operations and software engineering professionals who want to build infrastructure that delivers product and services at both speed and scale. The program includes projects that teach you how to create continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, deploy massive infrastructure securely using code, and operationalize microservices using Kubernetes. 
These projects will prepare you to become a successful DevOps engineer.
